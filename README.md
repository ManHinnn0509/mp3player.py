# mp3player.py
MP3 Player with Tkinter in Python

This is created for fun. Also because all the .mp3 players I have has the same issue, high CPU and RAM usage.

So I decided to create my own so that I can listen to music when I'm gaming without lag

PS I'm not professional with Tkinter / Pygame.

## Planned

* [x] [Add time control (Time slider?)](https://github.com/ManHinnn0509/mp3player.py/commit/6ec3a412478984309697aeb6518540c91b4c5288)
* [ ] Add lyrics display
* [ ] **Rework with better and clearer code**

## Known issues

* Might unable to open some .mp3 files (Due to encoding issue?)
* See [Issues](https://github.com/ManHinnn0509/mp3player.py/issues 'Issues')
