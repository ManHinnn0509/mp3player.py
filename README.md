# mp3player.py
MP3 Player with Tkinter in Python

This is created for fun. Also because all the .mp3 players I have has the same issue, high CPU and RAM usage.

So I decided to create my own so that I can listen to music when I'm gaming without lag

PS I'm not professional with Tkinter / Pygame.

## Planned

* Add time control (Time slider?)
* Add lyrics display

## Known issues

* Might unable to open some .mp3 files (Due to encoding issue?)
* See [Issues](https://github.com/ManHinnn0509/mp3player.py/issues 'Issues')
